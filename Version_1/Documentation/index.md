		<p>EasyParallelScene is a simple but powerful managing tool that enables developers to seamlessly manage 
		multiple scenes running in parallel to each other at runtime. With this tool, you can run multiple scenes 
		in the same world space without any interactions between them. It also allows you to switch between scenes 
		easily, bringing a selected scene in front while keeping the other scenes running in the background 
		(in parallel) and invisible to the player.</p>
